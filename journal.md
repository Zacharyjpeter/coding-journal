<h2><strong>#100daysofcode Challenge</strong></h2>
<h3><i>12.4.22 (Day Fourteen)</i></h3>
Today I tried to install Git using Homebrew. But I got stuck on creating zprofile. Learned how to create ordered lists. I was a bit faster today because I remembered general syntax rules.
<h3><i>12.3.22 (Day Thirteen)</i></h3>
Today I finally caught up to where I was previously in FCC. I reviewed how to use the <em>figure</em> and <em>figcaption</em> elements. I finally understand that most elements have an open and closing tag. They can also be nested within other elements. Elements are a critical part of learning HTML. <strong>I can improve by expanding my element library and remembering which elements produce the desired results.</strong>
<h3><i>12.2.22 (Day Twelve)</i></h3>
Today I reviewed how to use img src to link online photos. Coding syntax is important. I can improve by understanding how each element of code connects to the next and why.
<h3><i>12.1.22 (Day Eleven)</i></h3>
Today I re-learned how to use target="_blank" in an href element to open a new tab on click. Also re-learned how to add sections to my code. I can improve by finding a way to get more reps on each skill. It's difficult to remember what I've learned when I only use it once.
<h3><i>11.29.22 (Day Ten)</i></h3>
Today I learned my coding journal file extension was MD which means markdown. I changed it to HTML. I also learned VSC linting extensions help find syntax errors. What I can do to improve is implement more repetition. New skills don't stick without practice.

<h3><i>11.28.22 (Day Nine)</i></h3>
Setup VSC on new laptop. Created test doc in Github desktop. Reconnected VSC to Github profile to autosave changes like this. Will start daily coding practice on Thursday Dec 1st.
<br>
<h3><i>7.16.22 (Day Eight)</i></h3>
Worked on Cat Photo app from FCC. Learned how to open links in new tab with blank target, add sections within main, add undordered lists, and use the element figcaption. (today was the techlahoma code camp at Clevyr)
<br>
<h3><i>7.13.22 (Day Seven)</i></h3>
Added a skills table to my <a href="https://github.com/Zacharyjpeter/coding-journal/blob/main/Sololearn%20CV%20Project.html"> Fake CV Project</a>. Fixed the table border and spacing on <a href ="https://zacharyjpeter.github.io"> my portfolio website </a> under the project section.

<h3><i>7.13.22 (Day Seven)</i></h3>
Added a table to <a href ="https://zacharyjpeter.github.io"> my portfolio website </a> under the project section. The goal is to have projects posted like a showcase. Need to add links and space text out. Could potentially host example financial blog posts there too.
<Br>
<h3><i>7.12.22 (Day Six)</i></h3>
Added <a href="https://github.com/Zacharyjpeter/coding-journal/blob/main/Sololearn%20CV%20Project.html"> Fake CV Project</a> from Sololearn to project journal. Learned how to create lists. Added fake job titles and descriptions.
<br>
<h3><i>7.11.22 (Day Five)</i></h3>
Updated <a href ="https://zacharyjpeter.github.io"> my portfolio website </a>. Added three sections and spiderman gif just for fun. Started working on Cat App from FCC. Not sure how to link to FCC projects yet.
<h3><i>7.10.22 (Day Four)</i></h3>
CSS in Sololearn. Learned difference between inline, internal, and external CSS. Markdown doesn't support CSS. 
<br>Tried adding stylesheet to my website project. No luck. Started process of applying Jekyll theme instead.
<br>
<h3><i>7.9.2 (Day Three)</i></h3>
Started my <a href ="https://zacharyjpeter.github.io"> Github website </a> using VSC, Homebrew, and MacOS terminal!
<br>HTML in Sololearn. Learned how to add an image with alt text.
<img src ="https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-21/40/GitHub-1024.png" height="100px" alt="github icon"/>
<h3><i>7.8.22 (Day Two)</i></h3>
HTML in Sololearn. Learned difference between element and attribute.
<br><p align ="center">This is how you can make text shift on the page</p>
<h3><i>7.7.22 (Ground Zero)</i></h3>
HTML in Sololearn. Current project is a resume. So far I've learned how to use headers, line breaks, and text emphasis. Today I added a summary section using the "p" element and h1. This display is proof of my progress!
