<h2><strong>#100daysofcode Challenge</strong></h2>
<h3><i>11.29.22 (Day Ten)</i></h3>
Today I learned my coding journal file extension was MD which means markdown. I changed it to HTML. I also learned VSC linting extensions help find syntax errors. What I can do to improve is implement more repetition. New skills don't stick without practice.

<h3><i>11.28.22 (Day Nine)</i></h3>
Setup VSC on new laptop. Created test doc in Github desktop. Reconnected VSC to Github profile to autosave changes like this. Will start daily coding practice on Thursday Dec 1st.

<h3><i>7.16.22 (Day Eight)</i></h3>
Worked on Cat Photo app from FCC. Learned how to open links in new tab with blank target, add sections within main, add undordered lists, and use the element figcaption. (today was the techlahoma code camp at Clevyr)

<h3><i>7.13.22 (Day Seven)</i></h3>
Added a skills table to my <a href="https://github.com/Zacharyjpeter/coding-journal/blob/main/Sololearn%20CV%20Project.html"> Fake CV Project</a>. Fixed the table border and spacing on <a href ="https://zacharyjpeter.github.io"> my portfolio website </a> under the project section.

<h3><i>7.13.22 (Day Seven)</i></h3>
Added a table to <a href ="https://zacharyjpeter.github.io"> my portfolio website </a> under the project section. The goal is to have projects posted like a showcase. Need to add links and space text out. Could potentially host example financial blog posts there too.
